# Java-BSU
## Every lab is located on its own branch.


A repository with the JAVA labs (BSU/FAMCS).

## Structure 
- Master branch only includes `README.md` and default `.gitignore` for **IntelliJ IDEA**.
### Every lab branch includes:
- `.idea/` - **IntelliJ IDEA** project settings
- `src/` - Project *source code*
- `README.md` - Lab description with the *main task* and, optionally, comments on the solution.
- `.gitignore`
